# crud-js-back

This rest API demonstrate some basic  CRUD( create, read, update, delete) operations.

### What have I learn.
 It was a pretty simple to implement this rest API. I did encounter some problems during the way,    but nothing I could solve by myself.  It have helped me increase my confidence in my coding skill.
### Status: complete.
